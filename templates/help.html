<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p class="long">
This web application is designed for analysing thermal shift data.
Thermal shift, thermofluor, or differential scanning fluorimetry,
is an experiment measuring the thermal denaturation of a protein.
A dye is added that binds non-specifically to the hydrophobic regions of a protein.
As the protein is heated and starts to melt there will be an increase in the fluorescence of the dye
as more hydrophobic regions become exposed.
</p>
<p class="long">
Thermal shift experiments are often done in a high throughput manner using a plate reader
and can be used to study the effect of varying conditions or to screen ligands for binding.
This application helps with the process by fitting a curve to the raw data,
allowing for fast and accurate estimation of the melting temperature
and the ability to report on other parameters such as the gradient of the curve.
It also aims to provide a simple method of analysing the data.

<h2>Data Storage</h2>
<p class="long">
All data used in this application are held locally on the computer using it
with nothing uploaded to any remote servers.
Any data saved between sessions are saved using
<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp">local storage</a>.
This site does not use cookies.
</p>
<p class="long">
It is recommended that data sets are removed after analysis
as most browsers impose a local storage quota and problems could occur as you approach this limit.
Depending on the size of your data and the browser you are using the amount of storage available will vary.
</p>
<p>
Data sets can be removed from browser local storage while maintaining the plate layout and fitted curves
using the <b>Export</b> function on the <b>Input</b> page.
Exported data sets can be imported again using the <b>Import Existing Data Set</b> form.
</p>
</section>

<section id="data_input">
<h2>Data Input</h2>
<p class="long">
Input files can be uploaded using the <b>New Data Set</b> form.
Files must be in a delimited file format (e.g. CSV or TSV)
and contain a header row with column names <b>Well</b>, <b>Temperature</b> and <b>Fluorescence</b> (case-insensitive).
Other columns will be ignored.
Any number of lines can be present before the header row provided one of those lines doesn't contain these three keywords.
</p>
<p class="long">
Each row of the input file should represent a fluorescence reading.
There can be multiple readings at a single temperature,
which could be the case when handling raw data from a qPCR machine.
The <b>Well</b> column is expected to contain integers representing well identifiers for a 96 well plate (1 = A01, 2 = A02, etc.)
A small <a href="data/example.csv" download>example file</a> is provided as a reference.

<section id="curve_fitting">
<h2>Curve Fitting</h2>
<p class="long">
The curve fitting algorithm first identifies which of the raw data points should be included in the calculation.
Points to the right (higher temperature) of the highest fluorescence are discarded,
then points to the left of the lowest fluorescence are discarded.
The remaining points are fitted with a curve using non-linear least squares regression,
more specifically the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenberg%E2%80%93Marquardt_algorithm">Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm</a>.
Two models can be chosen: a five parameter sigmoid equation (Sigmoid-5) or a four parameter sigmoid equation (Boltzmann).
</p>
<img class="equation" src="images/sigmoid5.png">
<img class="equation" src="images/boltzmann.png">
<p class="long">
Where <b>n</b> is the minimum asymptote, <b>m</b> is the maximum asymptote,
<b>t</b> is a variable with units of temperature from which we can derive the melting point,
<b>a</b> is the Hill slope relating to the steepness of the curve and
<b>c</b> is an asymmetry factor that allows different gradients around the asymptotes.
Both <b>n</b> and <b>m</b> are kept fixed at the mininum and maximum fluorescence respectively
but <b>t</b>, <b>a</b> and <b>c</b> are allowed to vary without bounds.
</p>
</section>

<section id="melting_temperature">
<h2>Melting Temperature</h2>
<p class="long">
If the symmetric Boltzmann model was used in curve fitting then the midpoint of the curve is simply the parameter <b>t</b>.
When using the asymmetric Sigmoid-5 curve the the melting temperature can be measured as either the <b>Midpoint</b>
or the <b>Inflection</b> point of the curve.
</p>
<img class="equation" src="images/midpoint.png">
<img class="equation" src="images/inflection.png">
<p class="long">
The <b>Midpoint</b> should be closer to melting temperatures obtained by fitting a Boltzmann curve.
The <b>Inflection</b> point should be closer to melting temperatures obtained by finding a maximum
after numerical differentiation of the melting curve.
Numerical differentiation is not implemented in this application but is available in most qPCR processing software.
</p>
</section>

<section id="curve_chart">
<h2>Curve Chart</h2>
<p class="long">
The chart on the analysis page displays the melting curves for the currently selected wells.
Controls are available to show/hide the raw data <b>Points</b> and the <b>Model</b>,
to <b>Zoom</b> into the fitted region and to <b>Normalise</b> the data.
Data are normalised using the maximum and minimum fluorescence of the fitted region if avaliable, otherwise the raw data is used.
</p>
<p class="long">
An image of the chart can be downloaded in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format using the <b>Export SVG</b> button.
These SVG files can be viewed in a web browser
or converted to other formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.) using online tools or vector graphics software.
</p>
</section>

<section id="plate_layout">
<h2>Plate Layout</h2>
<p class="long">
Under the curve chart is a representation of the plate allowing selection of individual wells, rows and columns,
as well as the whole plate (rendering of this may be slow).
Selected wells are highlighted in blue and their well types can be changed to
<b>Reference</b>, <b>Blank</b>, <b>Control</b> or <b>Assay</b> using the controls on the left.
Only the reference wells have special meaning
as the average and standard deviation are used to calculate <b>ΔTm</b> and <b>ΔTm / &sigma;</b>.
</p>
<p class="long">
The controls on the right of the plate layout are used to refit curves to the selected wells.
The <b>Min T</b> and <b>Max T</b> inputs display the currently fitted region by default,
but can be changed to refit a specific subset of the data.
</p>
</section>

<section id="data_table">
<h2>Data Table</h2>
<p class="long">
The data table can also be used for selecting and deselecting wells.
Text columns can be filtered by typing some text into the box below the column header,
in which case only values that contain the text (case-insensitive) will be shown.
Numeric columns can be filtered by typing number, in which case only values that can round to the number will be shown.
Numbers can also be preceeded by a <b>&lt;</b> or <b>&gt;</b> sign to filter values less than or greater than the number respectively.
</p>
<p class="long">
The <b>Select</b> and <b>Deselect</b> buttons will select and deselect the filtered wells.
The <b>Export CSV</b> button will download the contents of the unfiltered table to a CSV file.
</p>
</section>

<section id="config">
<h2>Config</h2>
<p class="long">
The config page allows you to save different configuration values for each data set.
You can use the <b>Save Default</b> button to save the current configuration as the default to be used for new data sets.
The <b>Load Default</b> will load the settings saved in the default configuration
and the the <b>Reset Default</b> button will provide a factory reset of the default configuration. 
</p>
<p class="long">
The <b>Curve Fitting</b> options let you switch between the <b>Sigmoig-5</b> and <b>Boltzmann</b> equations,
and to choose which melting temperature estimation you would like to report on.
Changing the <b>Model Function</b> will refit all curves automatically.
There are also options to change the chart axis labels, which can be left blank to remove the label.
